    "### Exercise 4: Weather Data Aggregator (Dictionary problem)</font>\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "You are developing a software application that aggregates daily weather data from multiple sources to provide a consolidated daily report. Each source provides daily weather metrics like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, but the data might arrive in different formats or units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "Implement a Python function aggregate_weather_data(daily_reports) that combines and standardizes data from various sources into a single report for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item in daily_reports is a dictionary representing a weather report from one source for a single day.\n",
    "The daily_reports list can have multiple entries for the same day from different sources.\n",
    "Each report dictionary will have the date as a key (in the format of YYYY-MM-DD), and the value is another dictionary with the weather metrics: temperature (in Celsius), humidity (in percentage), and wind speed (in km/h).\n",
    "You need to consolidate these reports by averaging the values from different sources for each metric on each day.\n",
    "Example Input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "daily_reports = [\n",
    "    {\"2024-04-10\": {\"temperature\": 20, \"humidity\": 30, \"wind_speed\": 10}},\n",
    "    {\"2024-04-10\": {\"temperature\": 22, \"humidity\": 35, \"wind_speed\": 15}},\n",
    "    {\"2024-04-11\": {\"temperature\": 18, \"humidity\": 40, \"wind_speed\": 20}},\n",
    "    {\"2024-04-11\": {\"temperature\": 21, \"humidity\": 42, \"wind_speed\": 25}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"2024-04-10\": {\"temperature\": 21.0, \"humidity\": 32.5, \"wind_speed\": 12.5},\n",
    "    \"2024-04-11\": {\"temperature\": 19.5, \"humidity\": 41.0, \"wind_speed\": 22.5}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function starts by iterating through each daily report in the list.\n",
    "* For each report, it checks if the date is already in the combined data dictionary. If not, it initializes the dictionary for that date with lists of values for each metric.\n",
    "* If the date is already in the dictionary, it appends the metrics to their respective lists.\n",
    "* After collecting all data, it creates another dictionary to calculate the average of the metrics for each date by dividing the sum of each metric by the length of its list.\n",
    "* The function finally returns a dictionary with dates as keys and dictionaries containing the averaged metrics as values."
